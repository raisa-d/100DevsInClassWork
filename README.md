<p>Throughout the work I did in-class, I used HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and git for version control.</p>

## Lessons Learned
<p>Wow, the lessons are endless as this was an agency training program. I learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, git version control, how to work in groups with other engineers. I love both the back end and the front end and have had a lot of fun working with CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid, which I am learning now on my own. In class, we are just starting to talk about nodeJS.</p>
